        <h2>What is ConfessIt?</h2>
        <p>ConfessIt is a Roman Catholic examination of conscience app for web, Android, and iOS. It's designed to be simple and easy to use, and it can help you remember your sins when you go to confession. There's also a confession walkthrough that tells you exactly what the priest will say and how you should respond -- a great resource if you haven't been to confession in a while! The examination of conscience is based on fundamental Catholic church teachings, is easy to understand, and is relevant for modern Catholics.</p>

        <h2>History</h3>
        <p>I released the first version of ConfessIt for Android in 2012. At the time, I had just graduated from the Colorado School of Mines and wanted to get my feet wet with Android development. Since then, ConfessIt for Android has been installed more than 28,000 times and has a <b>4.7 star rating</b> after more than 730 reviews.</p>
        <p>Over the last 8 years, I've added many features and improvements to the app when I have time to work on it. I'm often asked whether there's a version of ConfessIt available for iOS, and until recently I've never been able to say yes. But now, in 2020, I'm finally releasing ConfessIt as a progressive web app at <a href="https://confessit.app">https://confessit.app</a>, with all of the core functionality of ConfessIt for Android. This new version runs on all platforms -- iOS, Android, and computers.</p>
